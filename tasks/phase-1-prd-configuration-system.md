# Phase 1 PRD: Configuration System for BagpackFlow

## Introduction/Overview

BagpackFlow's Configuration System is a YAML-based workflow definition system that enables both junior developers and non-technical users to create LLM workflows without writing code. This system builds on top of PocketFlow's core architecture and provides a declarative way to define workflows, reducing code duplication and enabling rapid prototyping of LLM applications.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, creating LLM workflows requires writing TypeScript code, which creates a barrier for non-technical users and slows down rapid prototyping for developers.

**Goal:** Enable users to define complete workflows using simple YAML configuration files while maintaining the power and flexibility of PocketFlow's underlying architecture.

## Goals

1. **Accessibility**: Enable non-technical users to create LLM workflows through configuration files
2. **Developer Productivity**: Allow junior developers to rapidly prototype LLM applications
3. **Code Reusability**: Reduce duplication across similar workflows through configuration templates
4. **Validation**: Provide comprehensive validation and error handling for configuration files
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing PocketFlow classes without breaking changes

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a junior developer**, I want to define a workflow in YAML so that I can quickly prototype LLM applications without writing boilerplate code.

2. **As a non-technical user**, I want to configure workflows through a simple config file so that I don't need to write code to create LLM applications.

3. **As a team lead**, I want to create reusable workflow templates so that my team can build consistent solutions and reduce development time.

### Secondary User Stories
4. **As a developer**, I want to validate my workflow configuration before running it so that I can catch errors early.

5. **As a developer**, I want to import/export workflow configurations so that I can share and reuse workflows across projects.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. YAML Configuration Parser
- The system must parse YAML configuration files
- The system must validate YAML syntax and structure
- The system must provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

### 2. Node Definition System
- The system must allow defining nodes with parameters in YAML
- The system must support all existing PocketFlow node types (Node, BatchNode, ParallelBatchNode)
- The system must support custom node types with parameter validation

### 3. Workflow Connection System
- The system must define workflow connections and routing logic in YAML
- The system must support conditional routing based on node post() results
- The system must validate that all connections reference valid nodes

### 4. Resource Management System
- The system must support centralized resource definitions (databases, APIs, LLM providers, etc.)
- The system must allow nodes to reference and use these resources
- The system must manage resource context and limits across workflow runs

### 5. Configuration Validation
- The system must validate node parameter types and required fields
- The system must check for circular dependencies in workflow connections
- The system must ensure all referenced resources exist and are properly configured

### 6. Workflow Execution
- The system must convert YAML configurations into executable PocketFlow workflows
- The system must maintain the same execution lifecycle as native PocketFlow
- The system must provide detailed logging and error reporting

### 7. Error Handling
- The system must provide clear, actionable error messages
- The system must validate configurations before execution
- The system must handle runtime errors gracefully with proper cleanup

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Visual Workflow Builder**: Web UI for editing configurations (planned for later phases)
2. **Complex Conditional Logic**: Advanced if/case statements and loops in config files (future enhancement)
3. **Configuration Inheritance**: Template inheritance and composition (future enhancement)
4. **Hot-Reloading**: Dynamic configuration reloading during execution
5. **Environment Variables in Config**: Direct embedding of secrets in configuration files
6. **Web UI**: Any web-based configuration editing interface

## Design Considerations

### Configuration Format (YAML)
The system will use YAML as the primary configuration format due to its readability and conciseness. Example structure:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "content-generation"
  resources:
    openai:
      type: "llm"
      config:
        api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
        model: "gpt-4"
  
  nodes:
    generate_outline:
      type: "llm-node"
      params:
        prompt: "Generate an outline for {{topic}}"
        resource: "openai"
    
    generate_content:
      type: "llm-node"
      params:
        prompt: "Write content based on {{outline}}"
        resource: "openai"
      depends_on: "generate_outline"
```

### Resource Management
Resources will be centralized entities that manage external service connections (databases, APIs, LLM providers). They will:
- Maintain connection pools and rate limits
- Handle authentication and secrets management
- Provide consistent interfaces for nodes to use
- Support multiple workflow runs with proper isolation

## Technical Considerations

### Integration with PocketFlow
- The configuration system must extend existing PocketFlow classes without breaking changes
- All existing PocketFlow functionality must remain available
- New features should be additive, not replacement

### Validation Strategy
- Schema validation for YAML structure
- Type checking for node parameters
- Dependency validation for workflow connections
- Resource availability checking

### Error Handling Strategy
- Pre-execution validation with detailed error messages
- Runtime error handling with proper resource cleanup
- Graceful degradation when resources are unavailable

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient YAML parsing and validation
- Minimal overhead when converting configs to executable workflows
- Resource pooling and connection reuse

## Success Metrics

1. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce time to create a basic LLM workflow from hours to minutes
2. **User Adoption**: Enable non-technical users to create working workflows without code
3. **Error Reduction**: Decrease configuration errors through comprehensive validation
4. **Code Reuse**: Increase workflow template reuse across projects
5. **Maintainability**: Reduce maintenance overhead through declarative configurations

## Open Questions

1. **Resource Scope**: Should resources be workflow-scoped or global across multiple workflows?
2. **Secret Management**: What's the best approach for handling API keys and sensitive data?
3. **Configuration Versioning**: How should we handle configuration file versioning and backward compatibility?
4. **Performance Monitoring**: What metrics should we collect to measure configuration system performance?
5. **Template Library**: Should we create a library of common workflow templates, and if so, how should it be structured?

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1.1: Core Parser
- YAML configuration parser
- Basic node definition system
- Simple workflow execution

### Phase 1.2: Validation & Resources
- Comprehensive validation system
- Resource management framework
- Error handling and reporting

### Phase 1.3: Advanced Features
- Conditional routing support

- Import/export functionality

## Dependencies

- **PocketFlow Core**: Existing node and flow classes
- **YAML Parser**: `js-yaml` or similar library
- **Validation**: JSON Schema or custom validation logic
- **Resource Management**: Custom resource abstraction layer

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Complexity**: Balancing simplicity with power
- **Performance**: Ensuring configuration parsing doesn't add significant overhead

### Medium Risk
- **Integration**: Maintaining compatibility with existing PocketFlow features
- **Validation**: Creating comprehensive yet user-friendly validation

### Low Risk
- **YAML Parsing**: Well-established libraries available
- **Error Handling**: Standard patterns for configuration validation
