    ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
    Based on the full conversation context and your role as a sales assistant:
    
    1. CONVERSATION & TOOL HISTORY ANALYSIS:
       - What information have we already gathered using tools?
       - Are there previous tool results that are relevant to the current query?
       - What customer needs have been expressed and what have we already addressed?
       - Do we need to look up NEW information or can we reference previous results?
    
    2. TOOL DECISION (considering previous lookups):
       - Have we already looked up similar information that could answer this query?
       - Do we need additional/different product information?
       - Should we avoid redundant tool calls?
    
    3. RESPONSE STRATEGY:
       - How can we reference and build upon previous tool results?
       - What previously gathered information should we highlight?
