# Part 2: Research Agent - Multi-Step AI Workflows 🔍

*Building AI from First Principles Series*

**Status: Coming Soon!** 🚧

## What We'll Build

A simplified Perplexity-style research agent that demonstrates multi-step AI workflows:

```
User Query → Search Web → Analyze Results → Synthesize Answer
```

## New Concepts You'll Learn

- **Node Chaining** - Connecting multiple nodes in sequence
- **External APIs** - Integrating search engines and data sources  
- **Data Transformation** - Processing and filtering information between steps
- **Error Handling** - Graceful failures and retries in complex workflows
- **Parallel Processing** - Using BatchNodes for concurrent operations

## Components We'll Create

```
components/
├── search-node.ts        # Web search integration
├── analyze-node.ts       # Content analysis and filtering
├── synthesize-node.ts    # Result compilation
└── research-flow.ts      # Orchestrating the full workflow
```

## Preview: The Research Flow

```typescript
class ResearchFlow extends Flow<ResearchStorage> {
    constructor(query: string) {
        const searchNode = new SearchNode(query);
        const analyzeNode = new AnalyzeNode();
        const synthesizeNode = new SynthesizeNode();
        
        // Chain them together: search → analyze → synthesize
        searchNode.next(analyzeNode).next(synthesizeNode);
        
        super(searchNode);
    }
}
```

## Why This Matters

This part bridges the gap between simple API calls and truly intelligent agents. You'll see how the same PocketFlow patterns from Part 1 scale to handle:

- Multiple API calls in sequence
- Data transformation between steps
- Complex state management
- Real-world error scenarios

## Coming Soon...

We're currently finalizing Part 1. Once that's solid, we'll dive into building this research agent that showcases the true power of the PocketFlow pattern.
