/**
 * ResearchFlow - The Complete Research Agent üöÄ
 * 
 * This orchestrates our entire research agent workflow:
 * 1. Start with DecideAction (the brain)
 * 2. Branch to SearchWeb when we need information
 * 3. Branch to AnswerQuestion when we're ready to respond
 * 4. Loop back to DecideAction after each search
 * 
 * Based on the PocketFlow tutorial: "LLM Agents are simply Graph"
 * This demonstrates the complete loop-and-branch pattern that makes agents work.
