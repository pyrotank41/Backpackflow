# Hands-On Exercises üéØ

*Part 1: Foundation - Practice What You've Learned*

## ü§î Understanding Checks

After running the examples, test your comprehension:

> üß† **Manifesto Check**: Can you see how we turned *one complex function* into *three simple ideas*? That's first principles thinking in action!

### Basic Understanding
1. **What happens if you remove the `post()` method?** Try it and see!
2. **How would you add a conversation limit?** (Hint: check `shared.messages.length`)
3. **What if you wanted to save conversations to a file?**

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Identify the three phases** in your own words:
   - prep() does: ________________
   - exec() does: ________________  
   - post() does: ________________

2. **Why is exec() isolated?** What's the benefit of not giving it access to SharedStorage?

3. **Give three examples** of other tasks that could follow this pattern (hint: think beyond AI)

## üí° Try This: Beginner Modifications

### Exercise 1: Add Message Timestamps
**Goal**: Add timestamps to every message in the conversation

**Starting Point**: Copy `examples/basic-chat.ts` to `examples/chat-with-timestamps.ts`

**Your Task**: 
```typescript
// Modify the Message type to include timestamp
type Message = {
    role: 'user' | 'assistant';
    content: string;
    timestamp?: Date; // Add this
}

// Update prep() and post() to add timestamps
// Display timestamps in the final output
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1. üë§ user (2023-12-01 10:30:15): Hello!
2. ü§ñ assistant (2023-12-01 10:30:17): Hi there!
```

**Hint**: Use `new Date()` to get current timestamp

### Exercise 2: Conversation Length Limit
**Goal**: Prevent conversations from getting too long (max 10 messages)

**Your Task**:
```typescript
// In prep(), check if conversation is too long
// If so, remove the oldest messages (except system messages)
// Keep the conversation under 10 total messages
```

**Test It**: Try sending 15 messages and verify only the latest 10 are kept

### Exercise 3: System Message Support
**Goal**: Add a system message that sets the AI's personality

**Your Task**:
```typescript
// Add systemMessage to SharedStorage type
// In prep(), always ensure the first message is the system message
// Don't let the system message get removed by length limits
```

**Test It**: Set a system message like "You are a helpful pirate" and verify the AI responds in character

## üî• Challenge: Intermediate Modifications

### Challenge 1: Multiple AI Personalities
**Goal**: Create a ChatNode that can switch between different AI personalities

**Requirements**:
- Support multiple system messages (professional, casual, creative)
- Allow switching personality mid-conversation
- Store the current personality in SharedStorage

**Advanced**: Create separate ChatNode classes for each personality

> üèóÔ∏è **Building Blocks in Action**: Each personality is just another *simple idea* - a different system message! Stack them together for multi-personality agents.

### Challenge 2: Conversation Persistence  
**Goal**: Save and load conversations from files

**Requirements**:
- Save conversation to JSON file after each message
- Load existing conversation on startup
- Handle file errors gracefully

**File Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "conversation-123",
  "created": "2023-12-01T10:30:00Z",
  "messages": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "personality": "helpful"
  }
}
```

### Challenge 3: Cost Tracking
**Goal**: Track and display the cost of each conversation

**Requirements**:
- Calculate tokens used (approximate: ~4 chars = 1 token)
- Apply OpenAI pricing (input vs output tokens)
- Display running cost total
- Warn when approaching a budget limit

## üß† Conceptual Exercises

### Exercise 1: Apply the Pattern Elsewhere
**Think of 3 non-AI examples** that could use prep‚Üíexec‚Üípost:

1. **Web API Handler**:
   - prep(): ________________
   - exec(): ________________
   - post(): ________________

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
   - prep(): ________________
   - exec(): ________________
   - post(): ________________

3. **Your Own Example**:
   - prep(): ________________
   - exec(): ________________
   - post(): ________________

### Exercise 2: Debug a Broken Example
Here's broken code - find and fix the issues:

```typescript
class BrokenChatNode extends Node<SharedStorage> {
    async prep(shared: SharedStorage): Promise<void> {
        shared.messages.push({ role: 'user', content: this.userMessage });
        // Issue 1: What should this return?
    }
    
    async exec(data: any): Promise<string> {
        // Issue 2: What if data is undefined?
        const response = await callLLM(data);
        return response;
    }
    
    async post(shared: SharedStorage, prepRes: any, execRes: any): Promise<string> {
        shared.messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: execRes });
        return execRes; // Issue 3: What should this return for a final node?
    }
}
```

**Your Analysis**:
- Issue 1: ________________
- Issue 2: ________________  
- Issue 3: ________________

### Exercise 3: Design a Node
**Design a "TranslateNode"** that translates user messages to another language:

```typescript
type TranslateStorage = {
    messages: Message[];
    targetLanguage: string;
    originalMessage: string;
}

class TranslateNode extends Node<TranslateStorage> {
    // Your implementation here
    async prep(shared: TranslateStorage): Promise<???> {
        // What data does the translator need?
    }
    
    async exec(???): Promise<???> {
        // How do you call the translation API?
    }
    
    async post(shared: TranslateStorage, prepRes: any, execRes: any): Promise<???> {
        // How do you store the translated result?
    }
}
```

## üé™ Advanced Exploration

### Advanced Challenge 1: Error Recovery
**Goal**: Make your ChatNode resilient to failures

**Requirements**:
- Retry failed LLM calls (up to 3 times)
- Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Provide fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- Log all errors for debugging

### Advanced Challenge 2: Streaming Responses
**Goal**: Show AI responses as they're being generated (like ChatGPT)

**Requirements**:
- Use OpenAI's streaming API
- Update the terminal output in real-time
- Handle streaming errors gracefully
- Keep the prep‚Üíexec‚Üípost pattern intact

**Hint**: The exec() phase might need to become a generator function

### Advanced Challenge 3: Multi-Model Support
**Goal**: Let users choose different AI models mid-conversation

**Requirements**:
- Support OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models
- Allow switching models during conversation
- Show model info in conversation history
- Handle different model capabilities
